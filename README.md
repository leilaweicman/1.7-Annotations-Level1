# 1.7.Annotations-Level1

## üìÑ Description ‚Äì Exercise Statement

This project contains the solution to the following Java exercises:

### Exercise 1
Create a hierarchy of objects with three classes:
- `Worker` (base class)
- `OnsiteWorker` (subclass)
- `OnlineWorker` (subclass)

The `Worker` class includes:
- Attributes: `name`, `lastName`, `pricePerHour`.
- A method `calculateSalary(int hoursWorked)` that multiplies the number of hours by the hourly rate.

The subclasses must override this method using `@Override`:
- **OnsiteWorker**: salary = hours √ó pricePerHour + static value of `gasoline`.
- **OnlineWorker**: salary = hours √ó pricePerHour + constant internet fee.

A `Main` class demonstrates the behavior of `@Override`.

---

### Exercise 2
Modify the previous classes to include some **deprecated methods** (e.g., an older version of the salary calculation).
- Use the `@Deprecated` annotation on those methods.
- From a separate class (`Main`), invoke the deprecated methods.
- Suppress compiler warnings with `@SuppressWarnings("deprecation")`.

This demonstrates the behavior of both `@Deprecated` and `@SuppressWarnings`.
